# Object Counting in Images

This project demonstrates a simple approach to counting objects (specifically vehicles) in an image using Python and computer vision techniques. The objective is to detect and count the number of cars in a given image.

## Introduction

Counting objects in images is a common task in computer vision. This project leverages Python libraries to detect and count the number of vehicles in an image. It focuses on counting cars, but the methodology can be adapted for other types of objects.

## Features

- Detects vehicles in an image.
- Counts the number of cars detected.
- Easy to use and customize for different types of images.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Cvlib
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization, optional)
